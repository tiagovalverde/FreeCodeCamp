# Simon Game

A [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) project part of the front-end certificate.

## User Stories

* I am presented with a random series of buttons presses
* Each time I input a series of button presses correctly, I see the same series of button presses but with an additional step
* I hear a sound that corresponds to each button both when the series of buttons presses plays, and when I personally press a button
* If I press the wrong button, I am notified that I have done so, and the series of button presses starts again to remind me of the pattern so I can try again
* I can see how many steps are in the current series of button presses
* If I want to restart, I can hit a button to do so, and the game will return to a single step (BONUS)
* I can play in strict mode where if I get a button press mode, it notifies me that I have done so, and the game restarts at a new random series of button presses (BONUS)
* I can win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct. I am notified of my victory, then the game starts over (BONUS)
